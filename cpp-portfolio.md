## 3 years in C++

I've learned C++ in [Yandex.Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.ru/cpp/) course "C++ Developer" as additional professional education (2021-2022)

I joined the team after graduating as senior student (mentor without commercial experience). At the moment I'm mentor, mentors manager and reviewer.

## My commercial experience

I'm working in Russian telecom company Bercut for almost a year.

I develop scripts, tests and C++ modules (extensions) for the [PCRF project](https://bercut.com/products/policy-and-charge-rule-function/). Besides reading 3GPP, I refactor colleagues code, format, control code style and consult them about Lua programming language internals.

This project has the highest priority and complexity level. During development I used company's proprietary interpreter written in C++ and Lua made specifically for telecom services. Everything else goes under NDA.

## Hanley Bot

My successful pet-project made for therapists in Applied Behavior Analysis (I was working in this field in 2019-2022). Telegram bot that controls groups for education and sends news about course people want to know about.

Bot is full written in C++ with Boost. As database I use PostgreSQL. Telegram and OpenExchangeRates APIs are used. Monitoring resources from Grafana. This project has a lot of template magic that I invented for state machine that is used for dialogs.

## Mentor's Scheduler
### NDA. Code available only for Yandex employees

Bot I developed for mentors to automate and simplify webinars' scheduling (I work as mentors manager in Yandex.Practicum). It automatically knows when mentor need to perform a webinar, asks him to schedule, then adds event to calendar and notifies curators.

Tech: C++, CalDAV, Boost, REST API, SQLite, JSON, XML, Conan

## Yandex.Praktikum

<img src="https://github.com/GitSparTV/Yandex.Practicum.CPP/raw/master/TransportCatalogue/svg.png">

Projects I made during Yandex.Praktikum "C++ Developer" course.

The course teaches C++ fundamentals and idioms, from basic logic up to multithreading, move semantics, remaking STL containers, making lexers and ASTs and more.

See **11** more showcases on the repo page.

## University admission watcher

For my wife and a friend I created a Telegram bot, that fetches the changes in admission lists and compares the last version with the new one.

The differences are reported to telegram channel. Even though I've had not much time to make the bot while it's still relevant, I followed code style, C++ idioms and DRY concept.

## globalize
### *https://github.com/GitSparTV/globalize*

Simple C program that installs other program to /usr/local/bin/. Uses Linux API.

## Contractor
### *https://gist.github.com/GitSparTV/4f122876ca1ead0ef04f4d9bdc489f61*

Multithreaded task splitter.

Contractor has one function and one work type. Each worker gets work from the queue.

Was used to compute `n!` algorithm efficiency.

# Lua C API
## lmemprof
### *https://github.com/GitSparTV/lmemprof*

Lua and LuaJIT library to profile memory consumption written in C++.

Currently, just hooks into allocator using lua_setallocf.

New concept will dump what structure exactly are sitting in the memory (like tables, strings, etc.).

## RemPos
### *https://github.com/GitSparTV/gmsv_rempos*

Garry's Mod C++ module written with websocketpp for iOS app Senzor app (by Stanislav RÃ©vay).

iOS app reads device accelerometer, gyroscope and GPS and pressure data and sends it to the websocket server open by module.

Server stores latest data packet and exposes getters to Lua guarded by mutex.

## LuaWheel
### *https://github.com/GitSparTV/LuaWheel*

<img src="https://github.com/GitSparTV/LuaWheel/raw/master/LuaWheelDemo.gif">

Lua module written in C++ with Logitech Wheel SDK.

Allows to get all parameters and fully control Logitech wheel.

## LuaCUE
### *https://github.com/GitSparTV/LuaCUE*

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5685050/142698638-164dd8ae-3e4f-4198-b3af-a210abdf9e74.mp4

App with Lua runtime with preloaded module for communicating with iCUE SDK (Corsair mice and keyboards).
