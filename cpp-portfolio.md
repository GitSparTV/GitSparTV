I'm learning C++ in [Yandex.Praktikum](https://practicum.yandex.ru/cpp/) course "C++ Developer" as additional professional education since Feb 2021 (Will graduate in Jan 2022).

I also coded a Linux program, Arduino programs and modules with Lua C API.

Projects I was making during Yandex.Praktikum "C++ Developer" course.

The course teaches C++ fundamentals and idiomatics, from basic logic up to multithreading, move semantics, remaking STL containers and more.

See **11** more showcases on the repo page.

## Contractor
### *https://gist.github.com/GitSparTV/4f122876ca1ead0ef04f4d9bdc489f61*

Multithreaded task splitter.

Contractor has one function and one work type. Each worker gets work from the queue.

Was used to compute `n!` algorithm efficiency.

## globalize
### *https://github.com/GitSparTV/globalize*

Simple C program that installs other program to /usr/local/bin/. Uses Linux API.

# Lua C API
## lmemprof
### *https://github.com/GitSparTV/lmemprof*

Lua and LuaJIT library to profile memory consumption written in C++.

Currently, just hooks into allocator using lua_setallocf.

New concept will dump what structure exactly are sitting in the memory (like tables, strings, etc.).

## RemPos

Garry's Mod C++ module written with websocketpp for iOS app Senzor app (by Stanislav RÃ©vay).

iOS app reads device accelerometer, gyroscope and GPS and pressure data and sends it to the websocket server open by module.

Server stores latest data packet and exposes getters to Lua guarded by mutex.

## LuaWheel
### *https://github.com/GitSparTV/LuaWheel*

<img src="https://github.com/GitSparTV/LuaWheel/raw/master/LuaWheelDemo.gif">

Lua module written in C++ with Logitech Wheel SDK.

Allows to get all parameters and fully control Logitech wheel.

## LuaCUE
### *https://github.com/GitSparTV/LuaCUE*

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5685050/142698638-164dd8ae-3e4f-4198-b3af-a210abdf9e74.mp4

App with Lua runtime with preloaded module for communicating with iCUE SDK (Corsair mice and keyboards).
